# Workshop 6: Implementing the Master node for Map Reduce

We suggest you to use a VM with Ubuntu 18.04 for the project development.

If you are using an ubuntu version that is 16.04 or older, please use install.sh, for newer versions of ubuntu use install\_ubuntu1804.sh
Similarly, there are two exampler folders for gRPC, one for ubuntu 16.04 or older (grpc) and one for ubunt u 18.04 or newer (grpc\_ubuntu1804)

## How to run the glog example:
1. Inside your build directory after compiling:
```bash
GLOG_logtostderr=1 ./glog.o
```
